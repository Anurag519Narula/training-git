    <h1>Quantum Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Quantum Machine Learning (QML)</b> is an emerging field that merges quantum computing and machine learning,
        leveraging quantum mechanics principles to enhance data processing. By utilizing properties like superposition
        and entanglement, QML algorithms have the potential to perform complex computations faster than classical
        methods, making them promising for tasks requiring significant data processing, such as in finance, drug
        discovery, and image recognition. QML often uses hybrid models, combining classical and quantum processing to
        maximize efficiency. Despite current challenges, including hardware limitations and noise, advancements in
        quantum technology are expected to make QML a powerful tool for complex problem-solving in the future.
